"""Run configuration: defaults, resolution, hashing, determinism.

CLAUDE.md §7: *never silently change a hyperparameter.* A run is fully
described by its config file; if a run needs a different learning rate that is a
new file with a new ``run_id``, not an edit. To make that enforceable rather
than aspirational:

* the *resolved* config (defaults merged in) is written beside the outputs and
  hashed, so the hash pins every value the run actually used, including ones the
  author never typed;
* ``assert_config_unchanged`` refuses to reuse a run directory whose stored
  config hash differs from the one being launched.
