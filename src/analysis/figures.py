"""The paper's figures. Post-hoc only; never imported by training code.

Every number plotted here is read from a run's own parquet output and its
`config.json`. Nothing is typed in from a results table, including tables in
`CLAUDE.md` -- a figure that cannot be regenerated from `runs/` is a figure whose
provenance the paper cannot defend.

**Arms that have no extract on this machine are omitted and named in the caption
line printed to stdout**, rather than being silently dropped. A four-arm figure
that quietly becomes a three-arm figure is the kind of thing that survives all
the way into a submission.

Style follows the project's data-viz reference palette (light surface, the first
three categorical slots, which are the validated all-pairs subset). The baseline
arm is deliberately *not* a categorical slot: it is a reference level, drawn in
muted ink so the three intervention arms carry the colour.
