"""Build a small analysis extract from a runs/ tree.

Answers the practical question "must I download the whole output every time?"
No. Per 200-task run the tables weigh:

    neurons.parquet    27.0 MB      per-neuron time series (C4)
    metrics.parquet     0.09 MB     per task x layer -- C2, C3, effective rank
    tasks.parquet       0.02 MB     per task -- the outcome measure, the gate
    recycling.parquet   ~0.05 MB    per event x layer -- the C1 composition table

So `neurons.parquet` is 99.6% of the bytes and none of the headline figures.
This script concatenates everything *except* the per-neuron log into one file
per table, adding a `run_id` column, giving a few MB that covers the gate, C1,
C2, C3 and C5 analyses.

    python scripts/make_analysis_extract.py --runs-root runs --out dist/extract

**The per-neuron log is not optional and is not deleted by this.** It is the C4
dataset, it cannot be reconstructed retrospectively (CLAUDE.md §5.4), and it
must stay in the archival Kaggle Dataset. This only changes what you *download*,
never what you *keep*.

Intended use on Kaggle: run this at the end of a session and download the
extract, while `runs.zip` goes to the versioned Dataset and stays there.

#: Everything except the per-neuron log. Adding `neurons` here would defeat the
#: entire point of the script.
#:
#: `intra_task` is small (only ~11k rows per run, and empty unless
#: `probe.intra_task_probe_every` is set) but it is the ENTIRE C5 measurement --
#: the post-task-switch death spike cannot be seen at task-boundary resolution.
#: It was omitted from the first version of this list, which meant the first C5
#: session's extract had no C5 data in it. Do not remove it again.
EXTRACT_TABLES = ("tasks", "metrics", "recycling", "intra_task", "learning_degree")

#: The C4 subset of `neurons.parquet` (CLAUDE.md §5.4, claim C4).
#:
#: The full per-neuron table is 23 columns of mostly float64 and ~27 MB per run.
#: Survival analysis needs when each unit died, how quiet it was, and whether it
#: was recycled -- not the pre-activation moments or the saturation flag. Keeping
#: the keys plus nine columns is enough to fit mortality curves, follow an
#: individual neuron across recycling events, and recompute `dead_absolute` at
#: any threshold.
#:
#: `mean_abs_act` stays float64: it is compared against thresholds as small as
#: 1e-6, and this is the file those numbers would be recomputed from. The weight
#: and gradient norms are survival covariates, never thresholds, so float32 is
#: ample and halves them.
#:
#: `sokar_score` is deliberately **omitted** although C4 uses it. It was the
#: single largest column (30% of the file) and it is exactly recomputable:
#: ``score = mean_abs_act / mean_abs_act.groupby([run, task, layer]).mean()``,
#: which is `probes.sokar_scores` by definition. Storing a derived column at 21
#: million rows to save one groupby is not a good trade.
