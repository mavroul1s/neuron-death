"""Stamp out one ready-to-run Kaggle notebook per job.

Every remaining experiment is independent -- none reads another's output, and
every learning rate is already fixed by the gate -- so they can all run
concurrently on separate Kaggle sessions. The only thing stopping that was that
the template notebook has `EXPERIMENT` hardcoded, which is how `gate_hi` came to
be run three times.

So: one notebook per job, each with its parameter block pre-filled and nothing
to edit. Open, attach the dataset, Run All.

    python scripts/make_kaggle_notebooks.py

Notebooks are named `NN_<job>.ipynb` in upload order and land in
`kaggle_upload/` beside the dataset zip.

## Before you run
1. Attach the code Dataset (the one built by `scripts/package_for_kaggle.py`).
   It bundles `mnist.npz`, so it is the only Dataset you need.
2. Accelerator → **GPU T4 × 2**.
3. Run All.

The config-count assertion in the "Pick the experiment" cell fails fast if the
Dataset is a stale version, rather than silently running the wrong sweep.

## When it finishes
- **`extract.zip`** — download this. A few MB; everything the analysis needs.
- **`runs.zip`** — push to a versioned Dataset, do not download. It holds the
  per-neuron log, which cannot be rebuilt after the fact (CLAUDE.md §5.4).

This notebook contains no logic: it imports from `src/` and calls one function."""
